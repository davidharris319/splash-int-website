        <h2>About Splash International Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          Created back in 1985, with a vision to sell giftware, a mere five employees, a small office, undersized warehouse, and relocating several times over the years from building to building, Splash International Marketing has now landed as a top supplier situated in our very own 60,000 sq. ft. building in Markham, Ontario. With over 40 employees, 22 Sales Reps, and our very own Head Office/Showroom and attached warehouse off Highway #7 and Woodbine Avenue, Splash has proudly grown to be a well-established supplier in the giftware industry in Canada.
